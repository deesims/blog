Hello, I'm Oleksandr, a software engineer. 

On day-to-day basis, you'll mostly see me reading and writing code.

I'm an active participant of calisthenics, I like video games and software. 
I'm addicted to Middle Age history. I'm also a big fan of objectivism, a philosophical movement by Ayn Rand.

If you'd like to contact me about any inquiries, email is in the footer.

If you'd like to check out my resume, [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iBqsN3DenNC_30Sg819S8tZMhYVgiZR0/view?usp=sharing).
